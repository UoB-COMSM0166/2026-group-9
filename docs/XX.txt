Vampire Survivor [**Chosen game**]

Game Idea:

Player is gonna survive under waves of enemy and mighty boss.

with various weapons and handy props, this survial journey could be

somehow "Enjoyable"(?). Our game is a 2D 3rd person rogue game, 

and below is our game feature:

[interactable map]: Refill your oxygen backpack on moon to keep yourself alive,

spraying water to give the Angry Boss a "Chill" moment and keep it cool and more.

[We make Bristol into our game!]: Yes we do!! and that's part of our plot!enjoy!

[WTH is this?]: Too many weapon and item for you to choose from, there's a set jsut for U!

[Awesome Boss Fight!]:We Love it! and everybody does!, they're getting  more difficult to deal with as game going.

[Twist?]: You think you're just a cell, killing germs and virus, but you find out you're a cancer cell,

in the end, player realise they're killing normal cells inside a healthy body, at the end, this plague kills the whole earth.
