## Type 1: Classic Arcade Games
### Game List
- **Snake** – A timeless arcade game where players control a growing snake to collect apples, avoiding self-collision and obstacles for a high score.

### Game Overview
Snake is one of the most iconic classic arcade games, defined by its simple yet addictive loop. Players maneuver a snake that grows longer with each apple consumed, with the core challenge being to avoid colliding with the snake’s own body or the play area walls. Its minimalistic design and easy-to-learn, hard-to-master gameplay have made it a staple across platforms for decades.

### Game Mechanics
#### 1. Game Objectives
- Guide the snake to collect apples scattered across the playfield, which increase the snake’s length and score.
- Survive as long as possible to achieve the highest score before a collision ends the game.
- Advanced variants may add moving obstacles or time limits to raise tension.

#### 2. Core Mechanics
- **Movement Control**: The snake moves continuously; players only adjust direction (up/down/left/right).
- **Growth System**: Each apple collected extends the snake, making self-collision more likely over time.
- **Obstacle Variation**: Static walls, moving barriers, or AI enemies may appear in modern iterations.

#### 3. Difficulty & Progression
- **Speed Scaling**: The snake’s movement speed increases with score, demanding faster reactions.
- **Dynamic Layouts**: Some versions add walls or alter the playfield as the game progresses.
- **Life System**: Classic arcade versions use a one-life system, while modern adaptations may offer multiple lives or checkpoints.

#### 4. Resource & Reward
- **Score System**: Apples award points, with bonuses for consecutive collections or rare “golden apples”.
- **Power-Ups**: Modern variants may include temporary invincibility or speed reduction to aid survival.

## Type 2: Puzzle Games
### Game List
- **Tetris** – A legendary puzzle game where players stack falling blocks (tetrominoes) to clear full horizontal lines and prevent the playfield from filling up.

### Game Overview
Tetris is a globally recognized puzzle game that defined the genre, renowned for its deceptively simple rules and endless replay value. Players rotate and position tetrominoes to form complete horizontal lines, which clear to free up space. The game ends when blocks stack to the top of the playfield. Its universal appeal comes from blending spatial awareness, quick decision-making, and rhythmic gameplay.

### Game Mechanics
#### 1. Game Objectives
- Rotate and place falling tetrominoes to create unbroken horizontal lines of blocks.
- Clear multiple lines simultaneously (e.g., a 4-line “Tetris”) for higher scores and delay game over.
- Survive as long as possible and chase the highest score before the playfield fills.

#### 2. Core Mechanics
- **Tetromino Spawning**: 7 unique block shapes fall from the top at a steady pace.
- **Rotation & Placement**: Players rotate tetrominoes and move them horizontally to fit gaps.
- **Line Clearing**: Full horizontal lines disappear, and upper blocks shift down to fill the space.

#### 3. Difficulty & Progression
- **Speed Increase**: Tetrominoes fall faster as lines are cleared, raising pressure.
- **Dynamic Modifiers**: Modern variants add color-changing blocks, power-ups (e.g., line-clearing bombs), or random block shifts.
- **Endless Gameplay**: The game continues until the playfield is filled, with no explicit “win” condition beyond high scores.

#### 4. Resource & Reward
- **Score Multipliers**: 2 lines = double points, 3 lines = triple points, 4-line “Tetris” = massive bonus.
- **Hold System**: Some versions let players “hold” a tetromino to swap with the current falling piece, adding strategy.
- **Power-Ups**: Advanced iterations include “line clearers” or “slowdown” to manage difficulty.

## Type 3: Vertical Shoot 'Em Up Games
### Game List
- **Airplane Battle** – A fast-paced vertical shoot 'em up where players control a fighter jet to defeat enemy waves, collect power-ups, and survive boss encounters.

### Game Overview
Airplane Battle (a “shmup”) is a classic arcade genre focused on high-intensity aerial combat. Players pilot a jet through scrolling levels, facing swarms of enemy planes, projectiles, and boss battles. The core appeal lies in reflexive gameplay, strategic power-up management, and surviving overwhelming odds. Modern adaptations often add co-op multiplayer, diverse aircraft, and dynamic levels.

### Game Mechanics
#### 1. Game Objectives
- Destroy enemy aircraft and avoid projectiles to progress through levels.
- Defeat stage bosses to complete the campaign, or chase high scores in endless mode.
- Collect points to unlock new aircraft, upgrades, or power-ups.

#### 2. Core Mechanics
- **Aircraft Control**: Move horizontally/vertically and fire continuous/charged shots at enemies.
- **Special Attacks**: Most versions include a “bomb” or “super attack” to clear projectiles and damage enemies.
- **Wingman System**: Some variants let players deploy AI wingmen for extra firepower or defense.

#### 3. Difficulty & Progression
- **Enemy Variety**: Enemies range from fast fighters to armored bombers, each with unique attack patterns.
- **Dynamic Scaling**: Enemy waves grow in number and intensity, with bosses featuring multi-phase attacks.
- **Roguelike Elements**: Modern versions may include procedural levels, permanent upgrades, or permadeath.

#### 4. Resource & Reward
- **Power-Ups**: Collectibles grant increased fire rate, spread shots, shields, or temporary invincibility.
- **Point System**: Enemies award points, with bonuses for rare targets or kill combos.
- **Aircraft Unlocks**: Points or challenges unlock new aircraft with unique stats and abilities.

## Type 4: Hybrid Strategy Board Games
### Game List
- **Wanning Chess** – A creative hybrid of traditional Chinese chess (Xiangqi) with mechanics from Go, *Three Kingdoms Kill*, and card games, creating chaotic, unpredictable strategy gameplay.

### Game Overview
Wanning Chess reimagines classic Chinese chess by blending mechanics from multiple strategy and party games, resulting in a dynamic, unpredictable experience. Unlike traditional Xiangqi’s strict positional play, it adds special abilities, random events, and crossover mechanics (e.g., Go-style territory control, *Three Kingdoms Kill* character skills) to appeal to both chess enthusiasts and casual players.

### Game Mechanics
#### 1. Game Objectives
- Checkmate the opponent’s general (like traditional Xiangqi), with additional win conditions such as controlling key territories or activating special abilities.
- Trigger “event cards” or combo abilities to secure instant victory.
- Adapt to random events and hybrid mechanics that disrupt traditional strategies.

#### 2. Core Mechanics
- **Xiangqi Foundation**: Retains basic movement rules and piece types (generals, advisors, soldiers, etc.).
- **Hybrid Abilities**: Pieces gain skills from other games (e.g., “grappling hook” position swaps, Go-style territory capture).
- **Random Events**: Card draws or dice rolls trigger terrain changes, power-ups, or enemy piece transformations.

#### 3. Difficulty & Progression
- **Rule Complexity**: Hybrid mechanics add layers of strategy, requiring mastery of both chess and new dynamic abilities.
- **Customization**: Players choose rule sets or character decks to adjust chaos levels, from casual to competitive.
- **Crossover Depth**: Leverage knowledge of other games (e.g., *Three Kingdoms Kill* card combos) to gain an edge.
